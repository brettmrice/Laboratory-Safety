# Staff Training {-}

In the context of emergency preparedness and exposure management, staff training is the critical variable that determines the success or failure of administrative plans. A perfectly written Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) or Exposure Control Plan (ECP) is useless if the bench laboratory scientist freezes during a fire or fails to wash a chemical splash immediately. Therefore, training in this sub-area focuses on **Response Competence** - converting knowledge into muscle memory and reflex action under stress

## **Regulatory Mandates for Emergency Training** {-}

Training is not optional; it is a federal mandate enforced by OSHA, The Joint Commission (TJC), and the College of American Pathologists (CAP). The administrative burden includes scheduling, executing, and documenting this training

*   **Initial Assignment:** Training must occur *before* the employee is placed at risk. A new hire cannot handle blood samples until they have been trained on the Exposure Control Plan
*   **Annual Retraining:** Skills degrade over time. OSHA mandates annual retraining for Bloodborne Pathogens (BBP), Fire Safety, and Chemical Hygiene to reinforce critical concepts
*   **Documentation:** Training records must be maintained for 3 years. These records must include the date, summary of content, name/qualifications of the trainer, and names/titles of attendees

## **Exposure Response Training (Chemical & Biological)** {-}

Training for exposures focuses on "Self-Rescue" and immediate First Aid. The goal is to minimize the severity of the injury between the moment of exposure and the arrival of professional medical help

### **Chemical Spills & Splashes** {-}

*   **SDS Interpretation:** Staff must be trained to locate and read Safety Data Sheets (SDS), specifically Section 4 (First Aid Measures) and Section 6 (Accidental Release Measures). They must know *before* using a chemical whether water makes it worse (e.g., water-reactive sodium)
*   **Eyewash and Shower Drill:** It is insufficient to simply show staff where the shower is. Training involves the physical mechanics: "Drag the injured person to the shower," "Pull the handle," "Hold the eyelids open with fingers," and "Flush for a full 15 minutes." Staff must understand that 15 minutes is physically exhausting and often requires assistance
*   **Spill Kit Usage:** Training typically involves a practical exercise using a "mock spill" (e.g., water or saline). Staff practice selecting the correct neutralizer (acid vs. base), donning appropriate PPE (heavy utility gloves, not just nitrile), surrounding the spill with dams, and scooping up the debris

### **Bloodborne Pathogen (BBP) Exposure** {-}

*   **Immediate Action:** Training emphasizes that the first step is *not* reporting, but *washing*. "Wash with soap and water for cuts; flush mucous membranes with water." Squeezing the wound (milking) is generally not recommended as it may promote tissue trauma
*   **Reporting Protocol:** Staff must be trained on the precise "Chain of Notification." They need to know exactly who to call (Supervisor, Employee Health) to initiate the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) window within the critical 1-2 hour timeframe

## **Fire Safety & Evacuation Training** {-}

Fire training moves beyond theory into physical drills. The laboratory presents unique fire hazards (flammable solvents, compressed gases) that require specific responses

### **R.A.C.E. & P.A.S.S.** {-}

These acronyms are the standard for hospital fire training

*   **R (Rescue):** Save people in immediate danger. Training emphasizes not becoming a casualty yourself
*   **A (Alarm):** Activate the pull station and call the code (e.g., "Code Red")
*   **C (Contain):** Close doors and windows to slow the spread of smoke and fire. This is critical in labs with negative pressure airflow
*   **E (Extinguish/Evacuate):** Use the extinguisher only if the fire is small (trash can size) and you have a clear exit path
*   **P.A.S.S.:** The technique for using an extinguisher: **P**ull the pin, **A**im at the base, **S**queeze the handle, **S**weep side to side

### **Drill Participation** {-}

TJC requires that 50% of annual fire drills be unannounced. Administrative planning ensures that laboratory staff participate in these drills

*   **Evaluation:** During a drill, observers check: Did staff close the doors? Did they clear the corridors of clutter? Did they know the location of the nearest Med-Gas shutoff valve?

## **Mass Casualty & Disaster Training** {-}

Disaster training prepares staff for high-stress, low-frequency events where standard procedures are suspended

### **Tabletop Exercises** {-}

For laboratory leadership and supervisors, training often takes the form of a "Tabletop." A scenario is presented (e.g., "A tornado has hit the West Wing; power is out, and the ER is flooding with trauma patients"). The team verbally walks through their response: "I would activate the downtime procedure," "I would call Blood Bank supplier." This identifies gaps in the plan without disrupting operations

### **Functional Exercises** {-}

For bench staff, functional drills test specific systems

*   **Downtime Drill:** The LIS is intentionally taken offline. Staff must practice manually labeling tubes, writing results on paper forms, and faxing critical values. This trains muscle memory for the inevitable computer failure
*   **Decontamination Drill:** If the lab is part of a hospital response team for chemical terrorism, staff are trained to don Level C PPE (Tyvek suits, PAPRs) and practice the decontamination of patient specimens or the facility itself

## **Workplace Violence Training** {-}

Recognizing the rising trend of violence in healthcare, training now includes "Active Shooter" and de-escalation modules

*   **Run, Hide, Fight:** The DHS standard response. Training helps staff identify escape routes ("Run"), secure hiding spots in the lab (locking doors, turning off lights - "Hide"), and as a last resort, using lab equipment (fire extinguishers, heavy objects) to defend themselves ("Fight")
*   **De-escalation:** For phlebotomists and front-desk staff, training focuses on recognizing the signs of agitation (clenched fists, raised voice) and using verbal techniques to lower the temperature of the interaction before it becomes physical
