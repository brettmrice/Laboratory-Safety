# Fire Safety Equipment {-}

The clinical laboratory is equipped with a tiered system of fire safety devices designed to detect, contain, and suppress fires. This system ranges from automated building-wide alarms to handheld tools for immediate intervention. Understanding the specific function, operation, and limitations of each device is mandatory for all laboratory personnel, as misuse can escalate a contained incident into a catastrophe

## **Fire Alarms** {-}

The fire alarm system serves as the facility's central nervous system, detecting danger and coordinating the evacuation

*   **Initiating Devices:** The system is triggered either manually by **Pull Stations** (located near exits) or automatically by **Smoke/Heat Detectors**. In laboratories, heat detectors are often used instead of smoke detectors to prevent false alarms from steam or chemical vapors
*   **Notification:** Activation triggers audible horns (usually the Temporal Code 3 pattern) and visual strobes (flashing lights for the hearing impaired)
*   **Automated Controls:** The alarm system interfaces with building operations to close fire doors (containment), recall elevators to the ground floor, and shut down HVAC systems to prevent smoke circulation

## **Fire Extinguishers** {-}

Portable extinguishers are active defense tools designed for small, incipient fires. Their effective use depends on the **P.A.S.S. Technique** (Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep) and selecting the correct agent for the specific **Class of Fire**

*   **Class A (Water):** Only for paper/wood. **Never** use on electrical or liquid fires (electrocution/spread risk)
*   **Class B/C (Carbon Dioxide - CO2):** Uses cold gas to smother fires. Ideal for flammable liquids and sensitive electronics as it leaves no residue
*   **Class A/B/C (Dry Chemical):** The standard "all-purpose" lab extinguisher. It uses a yellow powder to inhibit chemical combustion. While versatile, the powder is corrosive and can ruin electronic equipment
*   **Class D (Dry Powder):** Specialized yellow extinguishers used exclusively for combustible metal fires (Sodium/Magnesium)
*   **Class K (Wet Chemical):** Specialized for kitchen grease fires (saponification)

## **Fire Blankets** {-}

Fire blankets are sheets of fire-retardant fiberglass designed to extinguish fires by **Smothering** (cutting off oxygen)

*   **Primary Use:** They are the preferred method for extinguishing a **person whose clothing is on fire**. Unlike chemical extinguishers, they do not cause frostbite, chemical burns, or eye irritation
*   **Secondary Use:** Can be used to smother small containment fires, such as a burning beaker or trash can, by gently placing the blanket over the opening
*   **Operation:** Deployed by pulling quick-release tabs. The user must wrap their hands in the top edge of the blanket for protection before shielding the victim
