# Compressed Gas {-}

Compressed gases and cryogenic liquids are essential utilities in the clinical laboratory, powering everything from anaerobic incubators (Nitrogen/CO2) to Atomic Absorption instruments (Acetylene). However, they introduce significant hazards: high pressure (projectile risk), chemical toxicity/flammability, and extreme cold. Safe management relies on strict protocols for identification, physical handling, and protection against thermal injury

## **Labeling** {-}

Positive identification of cylinder contents is the first line of defense

*   **The Golden Rule:** "Read the label, not the cylinder."
*   **Mandatory Labels:** The only legal identification is the manufacturer's **written text label or stencil** on the cylinder shoulder. This must include the product name, concentration, and hazard warnings
*   **Color Codes:** Do **NOT** rely on tank color (e.g., assuming green is Oxygen). Color codes vary by industry and are not a substitute for the label
*   **DOT Diamonds:** Visual pictograms indicate the hazard class:
    *   **Green:** Non-Flammable (Nitrogen, CO2)
    *   **Red:** Flammable (Hydrogen, Acetylene)
    *   **Yellow:** Oxidizer (Oxygen) - *Must be stored 20 ft from flammables.*

## **Transport & Storage** {-}

Cylinders are high-pressure vessels that can become missiles if the valve is sheared off

*   **Transport**
    *   Always ensure the **valve protection cap:** is screwed on hand-tight before moving
    *   Use a **cylinder hand truck:** with a safety chain. Never roll, drag, or slide cylinders
    *   **Elevators:** Do not ride in an elevator with a cylinder (asphyxiation risk). Send it unaccompanied to a receiver
*   **Storage**
    *   **Restraints:** Cylinders must be secured to a wall or bench with a chain or strap (positioned 2/3 up the body) to prevent tipping
    *   **Segregation:** Store "Full" and "Empty" cylinders separately. Keep Oxidizers at least 20 feet away from Flammables

## **Cryogens** {-}

Cryogens are liquefied gases stored at extremely low temperatures (LN2 at -196°C; Dry Ice at -78.5°C)

*   **Hazards**
    *   **Tissue Damage:** Instant frostbite/burns upon contact
    *   **Expansion:** LN2 expands ~700x when boiling, creating an explosion risk in sealed containers and an asphyxiation risk (displacing oxygen) in small rooms
*   **PPE**
    *   **Gloves:** Loose-fitting cryogenic gloves (so they can be shaken off if liquid enters)
    *   **Face:** Full face shield mandated for pouring
    *   **Feet:** Closed-toe shoes; cuffless pants covering the shoe opening
*   **Handling:** Store in vented Dewars (never sealed tight). Use tongs for dry ice. Never dispose of dry ice in a sink
